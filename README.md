Loop Archival is a program that continuously monitors a location (plugged in
devices, directories, etc.) for new items. Then, it will move those items to a
specified destination. While doing so, if the specified destination requires
more storage than the allocated amount, the program will delete some of the
existing items, starting from the oldest item.
